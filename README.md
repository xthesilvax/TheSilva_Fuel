# Best Modification of the [Fix-Clean Vehicle Command v1.2.5](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-fx-fix-clean-vehicle-command/39409) 

## Explaining the reason for the modification
I started by changing this script because I thought it was an interesting idea but it was a little poorly programmed and not developed so I decided to improve, that's why I released this version üòÅ

## Installation
Just put it in the base and start the script in the **"server.cfg"** file.
```
start TheSilva_Fuel
```
**OR**
```
ensure TheSilva_Fuel
```

## Usage
If you are in a vehicle you can stocked it with the **/fuel** command.

## Config
Open the **"config/main.lua"** file and change what you need!

**everyoneAllowed** - It is false at default.
  - **True** - Everyone is allowed to use the command, you do not need to add anyone to the allowed table
  - **False** - You need to add people to the allowed table to give them permission to use the table

**Notifications** - It is true at default.
  - **True** - All notifications appear for the player
  - **False** - No notification will appear for the player

**AllowedList** - Enter your steam IDs and IPs. DO NOT forget the commas and do not add a comma at the end.

**Translations** - English language by Default (Change if you need!)
